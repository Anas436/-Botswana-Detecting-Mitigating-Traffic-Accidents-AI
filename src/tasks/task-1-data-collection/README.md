here i tried to extract the data from pdf files stored in "crash and claims reports folder"
and extracted the results in "collected data folder" by dividing the data into 3 categories "texts, images, tables"
the problem now that we need to solve is that the data is garbage.

** Note i added the pdf files in the .gitignore, because of size of these files, so it does not store them in github**
** you can put any pdf you like in this folder   "crash and claims reports " and run the code, and the results will shows in the folder "collected data" **
